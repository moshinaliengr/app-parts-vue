            This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are
            concerned with how their ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ (PII)
            is being used online. This policy applies to both online platforms,
            as well as desktop and mobile applications. PII, as described in US
            privacy law and information security, is information that can be
            used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or
            locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.
            Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear
            understanding of how we collect, use, protect, or otherwise handle
            your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our
            website.

          </p>

          <p>
            These apps read key vehicle data and then transmit the data to a
            server for storage. This data can be accessed by the owner of the
            vehicle (or a delegated third party) and allows the discovery of
            maintenance patterns and trends over the vehicle’s lifetime.

            <li>
              Vehicle reports are available through email if the end-user can
              prove ownership of the vehicle.

            <li class="inner-list-item">
              If a user can provide ownership of a vehicle, that person will be

          <p class="text-h6">How do we protect your information?</p>

          <p>
            Our applications and related websites are scanned on a regular basis
            for security holes and known vulnerabilities to make your use as
            safe as possible. We do not use Malware Scanning. Your personal
            information is contained behind secured networks and is only
            accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access
            rights to such systems and are required to keep the information
            confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you
            supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. Any
            vehicle data sent to Diesel Laptops is sent using the Secure FTP
            protocol (SFTP).
          </p>

          <p>
            We implement a variety of security measures when a user places an
            order enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the
            safety of your personal information. All transactions are processed
            through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our
            servers.

          <p>
            CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
            websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s
            reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or
            company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that
            operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information
            from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on
            its website stating exactly the information being collected and
            those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. – See

          <p class="text-h6">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</p>

          <p>
            When it comes to the collection of personal information from
            children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online
            Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal
            Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency,
            enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites
            and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety
            online.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years
            old.

          <p class="text-h6">Fair Information Practices</p>

          <p>
            The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
            privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have
            played a significant role in the development of data protection laws
            around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
            Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply
            with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
          </p>

          <p>
            To be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
            following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Within 7 business days</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We will notify the users via in-site notification</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Within 7 business days</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires
            that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights
            against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the
            law. This principle requires not only that individuals have
            enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
            have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or
            prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

          <p class="text-h6">CAN SPAM Act</p>

            The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,
            establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients
            the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells
            out tough penalties for violations.
